### Frontend
- **Flutter**  
- **Dart**

### Backend
- **Supabase**
  - Authentication
  - Postgres database
- **Flask (Python)**  
  - Hosted on PythonAnywhere  
  - Manages secure upload/delete/fetch of images to bypass Supabase’s storage limits

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend (Flutter)** handles routing, UI, state, and HTTP requests.
- **State Management**: `Provider`
- **Supabase** handles:
  - Admin authentication
  - Dynamic public data (Events, Announcements, etc.)
- **Flask Image Server** on PythonAnywhere for uploading/retrieving gallery images
- **Modular UI** per Institute (scoped by login account)
